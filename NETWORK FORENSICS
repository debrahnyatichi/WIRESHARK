                              NETWORK PACKET FORENSICS
OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) is a conceptual model that defines and standardizes the process of communication between sender's and receiver's system.
FLOW OF DATA FROM SENDER'S NETWORK:Application>Presentation>Session>Transport>Network>Datalink>Physical
FLOW OF DATA FROM RECEIVER'S NETWORK:Physical>Datalink>Network>Transport>Session>Presentation>Application

OSI Model and Their Functions
 7.Application layer-it provides network services to end-users,user interact directly with the software application 
 EXAMPLES:FTP,HTTP,SSH,SMTP,DNS,DHCP
 6.Presentation layer- responsible for encryption,decryption and compression of data to support application layer
 EXAMPLE:JPEG,SSL,TSL
 5.Session Layer- manage communication session between both connection multiple back-and-forth transmissions
 EXAMPLE:NetBIOS,RPC
 4.Transport Layer-responsible for establishing host to host connection between two nodes and transfer error free data
 EXAMPLE:TCP and UDP protocols 
 3.Network Layer- divides data frame into packets and adding routing concept through logical address
 EXAMPLE:ICMP,IGMP,IPv4,IPv6,RIP
 2.Data link layer-broadcast of data frames between two nodes connected by a physical layer
 EXAMPLE:MAC Address,ARP,PPP,ATM
 1.Physical layer-sending and receiving of raw bit streams in the form of 0&1 over a physical medium
 EXAMPLES:Cables and Connectorss,UBS,Wireless
